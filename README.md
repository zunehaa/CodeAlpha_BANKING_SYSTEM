# CodeAlpha_BANKING_SYSTEM
This is a console-based Banking System developed in C++ as part of my internship with CodeAlpha. It simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiryâ€”offering users an interactive way to manage their accounts within a terminal environment.
